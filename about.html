 <h1>About</h1>
<p>Hello! My name is Dyhara Gongora and I live in Petaluma. I attended UCSC for undergrad and majored in cognitive science. I originally wanted to pursue speech pathology but I now want to enter the UX/UI field. I am taking this class because I am very interested in developing websites and want to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. Something about web development that fascinates me are all the little components that make up the web pages we navigate on a daily basis. There is so much work that happens behind the screen to make websites and apps user-friendly and I am excited to learn all about it.
