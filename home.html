        A sexually mature adult <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axolotl">axolotl</a>, at age 18–27 months, ranges in length from 15 to 45 cm (6 to 18 in), although a size close to 23 cm (9 in) is most common and greater than 30 cm (12 in) is rare. Axolotls possess features typical of salamander larvae, including <strong>external gills and a caudal fin</strong> extending from behind the head to the vent. External gills are usually lost when salamander species mature into adulthood, although the axolotl maintains this feature. This is due to their neoteny evolution, where axolotls are much more aquatic than other salamander species.<br>Axolotls exhibit diverse color variations driven by mutations in their pigmentation genes. These genes play a crucial role in determining the coloration of these unique creatures.<br>Here's a concise list of axolotl color variants:
    </p>
    <ol>  
        <li><em>Wild-Type</em><br>The standard coloration for axolotls is brown/tan with gold speckles and an olive undertone. This serves as the baseline for comparison with various mutations.</li>
        <li><em>Leucistic</em><br>Mutations in pigmentation genes result in a leucistic axolotl, characterized by a pale pink hue and distinctive black eyes. This variant is visually striking due to its light coloration.</li>
        <li><em>Golden Albino</em><br>Axolotls with golden albino mutations exhibit a beautiful golden color with matching gold eyes. This visually appealing variant is highly sought after among axolotl enthusiasts.</li>
        <li><em>Xanthic</em><br>Xanthic axolotls display a grey color with black eyes, standing out as a unique variation in the spectrum of axolotl pigmentation. The grey hue distinguishes them from the typical wild-type.</li>
        <li><em>Albino</em><br>Unlike albino mutations in some other species, axolotl albinos are pale pink or white with red eyes. This albino variation is relatively common in axolotls and adds a touch of uniqueness to their appearance.</li>
        <li><em>Melanoid</em><br>Axolotls with melanoid mutations are characterized by an all-black or dark blue coloration. Unlike the wild-type, melanoid axolotls lack gold speckles and the olive undertone, resulting in a distinct and darker appearance.</li>
    </ol>

        Today, the axolotl is still used in research as a model organism, and large numbers are bred in captivity. They are especially easy to breed compared to other salamanders in their family, which are rarely captive-bred due to the demands of terrestrial life. One attractive feature for research is the large and easily manipulated embryo, which allows viewing of the full development of a vertebrate. Axolotls are used in heart defect studies due to the presence of a mutant gene that causes heart failure in embryos. Since the embryos survive almost to hatching with no heart function, the defect is very observable. The axolotl is also considered an ideal animal model for the study of neural tube closure due to the similarities between human and axolotl neural plate and tube formation; the axolotl's neural tube, unlike the frog's, is not hidden under a layer of superficial epithelium.[26] There are also mutations affecting other organ systems some of which are not well characterized and others that are.[27] The genetics of the color variants of the axolotl have also been widely studied.

    <p>The species is named after the Aztec deity <strong>Xolotl</strong>, the god of fire and lightning, who transformed himself into an axolotl to avoid being sacrificed by fellow gods. They continue to play an outsized cultural role in Mexico.[60] Axólotl also means <strong>water monster</strong> in the Nahuatl language.</p>
